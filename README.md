# Hareware: Instagram Post Generator

An automated tool to help [The Hare](https://theumdhare.com) staff easily create Instagram posts from article links.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` runs the app in workerd, the same runtime Cloudflare serves it
with, via the adapter's Vite plugin.

### When workerd will not start

workerd's allocator assumes a 48-bit userspace address space. Raspberry Pi's
64-bit kernel gives it 39 (`CONFIG_ARM64_VA_BITS=39`), so on a Pi it aborts
before it can start. This takes out `npm run dev`, `npm run preview` and
`wrangler dev --remote` alike — remote mode is no way around it, because it
still runs a local workerd to proxy through. It is a property of the machine
rather than of this project: see
[workerd#5020](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/issues/5020).

Building, typechecking and deploying are all unaffected. On such a machine,
check your work against a preview deployment instead of a dev server:

```sh
npm run build
npx wrangler versions upload   # uploads a version, prints a preview url
```

## Deployment

Pushes deploy through Cloudflare Workers Builds. `npm run deploy` publishes from
a terminal when you need it.
